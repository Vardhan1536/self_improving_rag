# Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with large language models.

It allows models to ground their answers in external documents.

# Chunking Problems

Bad chunking is the number one reason RAG systems fail in production.

If chunks are too small, context is lost.
If chunks are too large, retrieval becomes noisy.

# Industry Perspective

In real-world systems, chunking strategies are tuned per document type.

Self-improving RAG systems must detect chunking failures automatically.
