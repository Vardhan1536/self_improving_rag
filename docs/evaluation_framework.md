# Evaluation Framework

## Why Accuracy Is Misleading
Correct-looking answers can still be ungrounded.

## Faithfulness
Measures answer support from retrieved context.

## Grounding
Measures whether retrieval provided usable evidence.

## Confidence Estimation
Combines retrieval quality + evaluation scores.

## Refusal Policy
Low confidence answers are explicitly rejected.
